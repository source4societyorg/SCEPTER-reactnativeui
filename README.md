This is a modified boilerplate similar to that generated by the `react-native init` command. Repository adapted to work as part of SCEPTER

Useful boilerplate for starting mobile based user interfaces in react native while using SCEPTER. 

Please see [React Native: Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for information on how to install dependencies required for React Native.
